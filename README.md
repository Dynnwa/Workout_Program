# My Personal Project Proposal

## Fitness Program Generator

Often times I have difficulties 
deciding on what kind of exercises to do in the gym. 
Sometimes I can't decide whether or not to do a certain variation
or to do another variation when both have their own benefits.

I propose a solution to that, with this **incredible** 
application, the user will have the ability to create 
their personalized program according to factors such as:

- Muscle group
- Training Intensity
- Goals

## User Stories

- I want to be able to, create a custom workout based 
on my wants
- I want to be able to, add exercises to a workout 
program
- I want to be able to, remove exercises from a workout 
program
- I want to be able to, see all possible exercises for
a muscle group
- I want to be able to, swap out exercises for an alternative
- I want to be able to, save my current workout program if I like it
- I want to be able to, I want to load a previous program that I had

Phase 4 Task 2: inplemented a map interface with my program. The keys for
the map are muscle gorups and the items are lists of Exercises that train 
that muscle gorup.

Phase 4 Task 3: Now that I have actually finished my project, I would say a big thing for me
to refactor would be adding more abstraction into my GUI classes. I added the
UML to data.
